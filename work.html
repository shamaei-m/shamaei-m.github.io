                Bijan specialized in exclusive high-fashion designs. He never held a fashion show to exhibit his creations. His New York Times store was a curiosity in the city as it was by appointment only, to ward off the "untasty people." He once said "I do not want to sound snobby, but I have power, I have connections with all those people, I have homes all over the world, all you want for a 45-year-old man. I am a multimillionaire myself." One of his advertising slogan was "The costliest men's wear in the world". He designed a $10,000, 24-karat (parts), .38 caliber Colt automatic pistol ("Now you tell me, is this something a murderer would buy?") and a line of bulletproof clothing launched after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981 (a saleswoman claimed Bijan was the first fashion designer to make bullet resistant clothing). In 2010, he designed a limited edition Rolls-Royce coupé with a price tag of $1 million.<br>

Bijan's fragrances for both men and women are known for their distinctive circular glass flacon with an open center and a dividing web. When half full, the fragrance fills two separate chambers, seemingly defying the law of gravity that liquid seeks its own level. One of these perfume bottles is featured in the permanent exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution.[citation needed]<br>

                    Among his clients, Bijan claimed to count five U.S. presidents – both George H. W. Bush and his son, Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton – as well as politicians such as Tony Blair, Vladimir Putin, Kastriot Uruci, Najib Razak, Farah Pahlavi and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He also dressed other fashion designers such as Oscar de la Renta, Tom Ford, and Giorgio Armani, actors such as Tom Cruise and Anthony Hopkins, and professional footballers including Mick McCarthy and Liam Brady. He claimed to foster very special relationships with his customers, a key quality to know how to dress them best. Each purchase came with a notebook detailing how to wear it best.[Wikipedia]</p>
