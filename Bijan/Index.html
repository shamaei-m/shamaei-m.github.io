        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          Bijan Pakzad was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1940 (or 1944). He was the
          son of a wealthy businessman. He attended Institut Le Rosey, and
          studied design in Switzerland and Italy.<br />

          Bijan's career began in Iran with the Pink Panther Boutique in
          Tehran.<br />

          Upon immigrating to the United States in 1973, Bijan settled in Los
          Angeles and established his exclusive boutique on Rodeo Drive in
          Beverly Hills in 1976. He had initially purchased a parking lot that
          he turned into a building store, and was confident his business in
          L.A. would take off because "I saw brilliant men earning $100,000 a
          year dressed in the most ridiculous clothes".<br />

          In 1984, he opened a second store on Fifth Avenue`and 55th Street in
          New York (which closed in 2000).By 1985, he claimed 15,000 customers,
          including four kings and sixteen U.S. presidents. In his first ten
          years of business, he claimed a $150 million revenue. He owned a
          textile factory in Italy where he manufactured his custom-made
          clothing In 1989, the Bijan NY store was hit by the 2-year,
          $50-million renovation of the adjacent St. Regis Hotel, and launched
          litigations against its then-owner Sheraton.<br />

          In 2000, Bijan generated controversy when he published advertisements
          featuring a nude "rotund model named Bella", which were rejected by
          many New York magazines before being accepted by Tina Brown's Talk. He
          said the ads were an homage to painters Peter Paul Rubens, Henri
          Matisse, and Fernando Botero, whose art has featured full-figured
          women, and said "I embrace the beauty of all women". Once they were
          published in Talk, the ads were accepted by several of the
          publications that had previously rejected them.<br />

          On April 14, 2011, Bijan suffered a stroke and was rushed to
          Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He had brain surgery, but
          never recovered and died two days later on April 16, 2011 at 8:05 am.
          Public records indicate he was 71. Bijan's boutique on Rodeo Drive was
          sold to LVMH for US$122 million in August 2016. The boutique moved
          across the street in 2020. [Wikipedia]
